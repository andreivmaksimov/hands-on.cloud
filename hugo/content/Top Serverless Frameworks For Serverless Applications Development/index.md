Are you eager to learn and use Serverless technology and its frameworks? "Now" is always a good time. In this article, we'll provide a review of the most popular ones. And we hope, you'll be able to pick the most suitable framework for your needs.

During the last couple of years, Serverless computing has gained massive popularity. People started to fall in love with the concept of creating more by managing less. For most organizations, Serverless technology is still considered new. But more and more companies are investing their time and effort into this idea.

## Frameworks for creating Serverless Apps.

There are several frameworks available today, and each comes with its unique features. If you are keen on starting a new project but not sure of which framework to engage, then below are the best Serverless frameworks to consider!

### Apex Up.

The [Up](https://up.docs.apex.sh/) framework helps you deploy infinitely scalable applications within seconds. It gives you the flexibility to work on what truly matters to you.

{{< my-picture name="Apex-Up-Framework" >}}

This serverless framework focuses on the deployment of static websites and API gateways. You can build your web applications with your favorite frameworks, like Koa and Express. No need to learn new languages. The Up framework supports Crystal, Java, Python, and many other runtimes.

#### Pros of Apex Up.

* Features AWS integration.
* Powerful Uptime Monitoring.
* And [18 more](https://apex.sh/up/#features) on their website.

### Apache OpenWhisk.

The [Apache OpenWhisk](https://openwhisk.apache.org/) is a distributed Serverless platform that implements functions as a response to events at scale. This open-source framework allows you to build your own Serverless infrastructure. It helps you to manage your Serverless infrastructure at scale using Docker containers. You're increasing efficiency and focus on your applications.

{{< my-picture name="Apache-OpenWhisk-Framework" >}}

The OpenWhisk event established its own terminology. You as a developer is creating your functions, which called [Actions](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/master/docs/actions.md#openwhisk-actions)). You may choose almost any language including Rust! And the framework will run your functions in response to events via [Triggers](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/master/docs/triggers_rules.md#creating-triggers-and-rules).

#### Pros of Apache OpenWhisk.

* Easy integration with popular services via [Packages](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/master/docs/packages.md).
* Runs on top of your infrastructure and scales per-request.
* Works in Kubernetes.

### AWS Amplify Framework.

The [Amplify Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) is a solution designed for creating cloud-enabled mobile and web apps, comprising of interactive CLI toolchain, libraries, and UI components.

{{< my-picture name="Amplify-Framework" >}}

This framework focused on front-end and mobile developers who create Serverless cloud-based applications. It delivers a declarative interface alongside easy CLI management for most operation types in building your app. As this is the AWS framework it integrates well with all AWS cloud services.

#### Pros of AWS Amplify.

* An easier and faster way to build cloud-connected, full-stack mobile and web applications.
* No need to manage infrastructure and hosting â€“ leverage services like AWS Lambda and AppSync.
* Native integration with AWS services.
* Supperts GraphQL - an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs.

### Claudia.js.

The [Claudia.js](https://claudiajs.com/) framework provides developers a relaxed approach to deploy Node.js-based projects to API gateway and AWS Lambda.

{{< my-picture name="ClaudiaJS-Framework" >}}

The framework automates all configuration and deployment tasks. It also set up everything that you would expect as a JavaScript developer out of the box. Claudia.js promises, that you can start quick Lambda function development with a focus on your business problems first.

#### Pros of Claudia.js.

* Promises to free you from learning Swagger.
* Deploy, manage, and update using simple commands.
* Removes boilerplate stuff.

### Middy.

[Middy](https://middy.js.org/) offers a middleware engine that allows you to simplify your AWS Lambda code written in Node.js.

{{< my-picture name="Middy-Framework" >}}

The framework aims to solve the problem of input parsing and validation, output serialization and error handling. The main idea is to move this stuff to a separate independent modules. So, Middy developers fighting for clean, readable, and easy to maintain business logic.

#### Pros of Middy.

* Ability to maintain clean and structured code.

### Nuclio.

[Nuclio](https://nuclio.io/) is an open-source Serverless platform that automates the deployment of data-science apps and minimizes their development and maintenance overhead.

{{< my-picture name="Nuclio-Framework" >}}

The platform is a high-performance framework focused on data, I/O, and compute-intensive workloads. Nuclio is useful in the following ML pipeline tasks:

* Data collectors, ETL, stream processing.
* Data preparation and analysis.
* Hyperparameter model training.
* Real-time model serving.
* Feature vector assembly (real-time data preparation).

#### Pros of Nuclio.

* Supports Kubernetes - you can deploy it on every cloud platform.
* Supports languages like Go, Java, .NET Core, NodeJS, and Python.
* Support CPU and GPU workloads.

### Pulumi.

The [Pulumi](https://pulumi.io/) is an open-source framework that helps you create, deploy, and manage cloud-based applications. It is very interesting how Pulumi compares itself with [other infrastructure management tools](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/vs/).

{{< my-picture name="Pulumi-Framework" >}}

Instead of YAML or domain-specific language, Pulumi leverages existing programming languages, their native tools, and libraries. Right now it supports TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, and .NET.

Pulumi can simplify infrastructure management tasks for AWS, Azure, GCP, and Kubernetes. It allows you to simplify [Lambda functions deployment](https://www.pulumi.com/serverless/) and management as well.

#### Pros of Pulumi.

* Support multiple cloud providers and Kubernetes.
* Low learrning bar - only 5 minutes needed to get started with every Cloud platform.

{{< my-picture name="Serverless-Framework" >}}

Basically you need only 3 commands to be able to deploy Zappa project: install, init and deploy. That's it. This Framework supports rollbacks, scheduling, logs tailing, remote function invocation, SSL certificates for custom domains and much more.

#### Pros of Zappa.

## Conclusion.

There're so many amazing Serverless frameworks nowadays! Most of them will help you to start up a project in a quick time. But they are not easily comparable as they tend to be designed to cater for defined tasks. Having some requirements in place can help to choose a suitable framework for your project.

The final focus is certainly on the user experience. Some frameworks can help you get the whole process running in no time. While others may need the addition of out-of-the-box tools.

I hope, this article will help you to choose the one which suits your needs. Meanwhile, I wish you yo enjoy the endless possibilities of a Serverless world.

If you found this article useful, please, help to spread it to the world!
